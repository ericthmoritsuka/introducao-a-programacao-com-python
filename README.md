# Introduction to Programming with Python

This is a repository I made for exercises from the book Introduction to Programming with Python by Nilo Ney Coutinho Menezes, published by Novatec. The repo is divided in chapters just like the book. Most of the exercises have dedicated files. Some of them are condensed in just one.
